# KrayFilters
*"KrayFilters"* was the first thing that came to my headâ€¦

Just a quick little [GPUImage](https://github.com/BradLarson/GPUImage) hack. 

The app works with about 20-24FPS on iPhone 5.  Other devices not tested, will most likely be slower.

## Setup
You need [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) installed.

##### In terminal:
- ```git clone https://github.com/mglagola/KrayFilters.git```
- ```cd KrayFilters```
- ```pod install```
- ```open KrayFilters.xcworkspace```
